h1. About

Very low-level AMQP 0.9.1 client which is supposed to be used for implementing more high-level AMQP libraries rather than to be used by the end users.

_Caution: this is *VERY EXPERIMENTAL*! It will be likely renamed at the future as we'll get a clearer vision what it actually should do :)_

h1. Usage

Install by running @gem install amq-client@.

<pre>
require "amq/client/adapters/socket"

AMQ::Client::Settings.register_io_adapter(AMQ::Client::SocketAdapter)
</pre>

h2. Nightly Builds

You can always find nightly builds at "gems.101ideas.cz":http://gems.101ideas.cz. You can install them thusly:

<pre>
wget http://gems.101ideas.cz/amq-client-nightly.gem
gem install amq-client-nightly.gem
</pre>

_*NOTE:* This could be better achieved by a gem server, but it's just utterly broken._

h2. Git Repository

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-client.git --recursive
</pre>

Or, if you are on an older version of Git:

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-client.git
git submodule update --init
</pre>
