h2. About amq-client

amq-client is a fully-featured, low-level AMQP 0.9.1 client. It's sweet spot is
in serving as foundation for higher-level, more opinionated AMQP libraries.
It can be used directly by applications code when performance and access to
advanced AMQP protocol features is more important that API convenience.

h2(#amqp_gems_family). How amq-client does relate to amqp gem, amq-protocol and libraries like bunny?

 * At the lowest level, "AMQ-Protocol gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-protocol takes care of encoding, decoding and framing.
 * One level above is "AMQ-Client gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-client that takes care of network I/O, provides uniform interface for
various I/O libraries like "EventMachine":http://rubyeventmachine.com/, "cool.io":http://coolio.github.com/ or good old TCP sockets and implements
AMQP protocol entities (queues, exchanges, channels and so on) with emphasis on access to every feature available over API convenience or
conciseness.
 * Finally, end applications use
